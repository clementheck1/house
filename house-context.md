Project Services

Pre-Project Planning
We'll start by visiting your site to review your project, understand and confirm your expectations, and discuss the lifting process.

Plans & Permits
During this project phase, we'll work with you to retain a structural engineer who will develop the construction documents required to obtain a building permit & guide the foundation contractor regarding materials and plans.

Project Lift Off
Now the fieldwork starts. DR House Lifting will arrive on site and complete a safety walk to ensure all utilities are properly disconnected. We'll secure the area, guarantee all exterior stairs and porches are detached and create access for the lift equipment. Next, after positioning the structural lifting beams and jacking towers, the lift will begin, providing access for the repair contractor who will repair or create the foundation.

Following eight years of research and development, the Atlas HLS 5.0 has been utilized on over 100 successful house lifts in North America. Used in coastal and inland flooded areas, extremely windy conditions, Canadian winters, and on the highly unstable clay-based soil that covers much of the Great Plains, the Atlas HLS 5.0 has proven to be an extremely reliable and safe method of house lifting. The versatility of the system allows adaptation to challenging or awkward site conditions.
